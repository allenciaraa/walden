<h2>About</h2>
<p>A 32-bit treasure hunt adventure featuring heroes of the literary world, made with Java and Java Swing.</p>
<p>This project was primarily developed during my undergraduate studies to strengthen my understanding of Java Swing. As I advanced, I found more problems I wanted to figure out how to solve, leading to an expansion of the project's scope. This culminated in the creation of, ultimately, a pretty silly game that features custom tilemaps, sprites, and a unique soundtrack. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into game design and development, while also enjoying the creative journey.</p>
